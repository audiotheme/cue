*Cue* makes it easy to create and manage beautiful, fully responsive audio playlists. Primarily built with music in mind, *Cue* can also be used for podcasts, sermons or to showcase voice over samples.

There's no need to fiddle with XML, JSON, or FTP. Just upload audio files with the familiar WordPress Media Manager, then insert them into a playlist with the click of a button. *Cue* fetches metadata from uploaded files to automatically complete the title, artist, and length for each track.

It works on desktop, tablets, and other mobile devices.


## Features
